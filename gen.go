// Package gen is a generic general use Go functions library
// which can be used throughout any project.
//
// As a rule the methods in this package are non-destructive
// and return a new value rather than modifying the original.
//
// To import this package it is recommended that you use a `.`
// import like so:
//
// import . "go.structs.dev/gen"
//
// This allows for methods in `gen` to be used directly within
// the same namespace without needing to prefix them with `gen.`
